# Periodica

Periodica is a
C++ based Python library for analyzing the topological structures
of a periodic set. It can compute how the points connect with
each other (captured by the Delaunay triangulation) at different
length scales (encoded in the periodic merge tree and the
topological descriptors). For more information, please check our 
[CECAM workshop poster](cecam_poster.pdf).
